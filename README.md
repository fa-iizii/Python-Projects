# Python-Projects

This repository contains simple Python projects that I made for fun. Each project is contained in its own folder and includes a README file with more information about the project.

## Simple Python Projects

- **Password Generator:** This is a simple Python program that generates a random password based on user-specified criteria, such as length and character set. The program prompts the user to specify the length of the password and the character set to use, which can include uppercase letters, lowercase letters, digits, and special characters. The program then generates a random password based on those criteria and prints it to the console.

This project can help you learn about several key concepts in Python programming, including:

    User input and error handling
    Working with strings and characters
    Generating random values
    Conditional statements and logical operators

You can customize this program to suit your needs, such as by adding more complex password generation algorithms or integrating it with other programs. Additionally, you can explore ways to securely store and manage passwords, such as using encryption and password management tools.
